# Soton-November-DOJO

Made in 90 minutes for the 12-11-2015 Southampton Code Dojo.

A Python script for '[Gerrymandering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerrymandering)' 10,000 voters into 10 constituancies, so that a chosen side wins.

It finds a solution via brute force methods. Randomly generates vertical-band-shaped constituancies, until the chosen side holds the majority.
